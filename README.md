# Klarna UI CSS Components

This project contains CSS components to be used in all [Klarna](http://klarna.com/) user facing projects.

The showroom of these components is available online at
[klarna.github.io/ui-css-components](http://klarna.github.io/ui-css-components).

The reference for its implementation is [Klarna's styleguide](https://github.com/klarna/styleguide).

The project follows a non strict version of [BEM](https://en.bem.info/), and it doesn't include any kind of JavaScript so no behaviour is defined. If you use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) use the [ui-react-components](https://github.com/klarna/ui-react-components/).

#### Running locally

To run the showroom locally:

```sh
npm install
make dev
```
