# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. http://keepachangelog.com/

## 1.6.2

### Updated

- `cui__icon`s now have `pointer-events: none` so that taps and clicks will pass through them.

### Added

- Bubble atom (+ snippet): `cui__bubble`
- Bubble atom pointing upwards: `cui__bubble--below`

- Snippets for the new tooltip atom.

### Changed

- The checkbox is now a configurable mixin as well as a class.
